# Project Overview
## https://test1-seven-eta.vercel.app

## Project Structure
The project has been developed using React and Next.js to create a seamless and interactive single-page application.

## Components
- **Header Component:** This component prominently displays the page header text and dynamically updates the number of items in the cart.
- **Category Component:** Users can explore a range of categories, enabling them to filter products based on their chosen category and color preference.
- **Products Component:** This section showcases a comprehensive list of products. Users can personalize their view by utilizing filters and sorting options.
- **ProductItem Component:** Each product is elegantly displayed, showcasing pertinent information and details for individual items.

## Cart Context
A dedicated context has been implemented to offer users insights into their shopping cart's contents. The context also facilitates operations related to product addition.

## Functionalities
- **Category Filtering:** Users can effortlessly select a specific category to exclusively display products belonging to that category.
- **Color Filtering:** The color filter feature allows users to refine their search, showcasing products only in their preferred color.
- **Product Sorting:** The project empowers users to sort products by price or name, enhancing the shopping experience.
- **Adding Products to Cart:** A seamless process allows users to easily add products to their cart, enhancing convenience.
- **Decreasing Product Stock:** Whenever a product is added to the cart, the stock availability of that item is appropriately reduced.

## Animations
- **Hover Animation:** As an engaging user interaction, hovering over a category in the Category component triggers a captivating scaling animation using the Framer Motion library.
- **"Add to Cart" Animation:** To emphasize the act of adding a product to the cart, a subtle animation draws attention to the "Add to Cart" button, enhancing user engagement.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
